In this project, I will be cleaning a purposefully dirty dataset of cafe sales. I will then analyze the cleaned data to generate insights. Finally, I will perform a time series analysis on the data. 

The original data is called: dirty_cafe_sales.csv

I then performed various levels of cleaning based on the columns I wanted to analyse. For example, clean_cafe_items.csv is specifically cleaned to analyse the items column. The same applies to every other clean data csv file present.
